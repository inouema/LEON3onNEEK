This version, modutils-2.2.2, has its roots in both the modules-2.*.*
series and the subsequent modutils-2.1.* series.

Many things have changed since either of them were released, especially
since the module support in the kernel was upgraded during Linux-2.1.*.

Bjorn Ekwall <bj0rn@blox.se> is responsible for the bulk of the actual
code on the modules-2.*.* utilities, as well as the restructuring and
additions since modutils-2.1.121.

Jacques Gelinas <jack@solucorp.qc.ca> wrote the original depmod/modprobe
and was "the other half" of the development team for most of the rest
of the modules-2.*.* work.

Richard Henderson <rth@cygnus.com> is responsible for the major rewrites
that resulted in modutils-2.1.121, where the new genksyms, insmod and
generic object file handling are especially noteworthy. As a result,
the cross-platform portability of the utilites was greatly enhanced.

Other developers have been of great assistance, too many to mention
in this document. Look in ChangeLog for the names of most of them.
