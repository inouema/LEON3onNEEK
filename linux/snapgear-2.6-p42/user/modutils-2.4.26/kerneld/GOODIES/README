Here is yet another set of examples of the uses of the kerneld message channel.
They might be seen as simple minded, but rather entertaining.

The net result is that you now can create _any_ sound instead of a
normal "beep", or create your own "Flying Linux screen blanker".

Please make sure that the screen blanker cleans up after itself, and exits,
when it receives SIGQUIT!

Apply the patch, compile the "kdsound" daemon and install it together
with your own "do_sound" in "/sbin".

To make the "beeper" work automatically, just add this to your "/etc/rc.local",
or just about anywhere, after the startup of "kerneld":
	if [ -x /sbin/kdsound ]; then
		/sbin/kdsound 2> /dev/console &
	fi

And; _you_ decide how the screen blanker should look...

NOTE!  This is just an example of how it can be done!
The _real_ support will be released later, although in principle it
will look _very_ similar (but a lot nicer...)!
