From modutils-2.2.2-pre6:

	- Are there more optimizations to do for handling meta-characters?
	  Example: look for $VAR in the environment instead of "/bin/echo"

	- Check for full (and consistent) set of options for all apps,
	  especially depmod vs. modprobe (and insmod too)


Remaining from modutils-2.1.121:

insmod:

	- Persistant module parameters.

util: (alias.h)
insmod: (modprobe.c)
depmod: (depmod.c)

	- Finalize MODULE_SUPPORTED_DEVICE info so that we can replace
	  the hardcoded alias array with info gleened from the modules
	  themselves.
	* Bjorn says: One way is to use the "include" directive...
	  Otherwise, an extension to the modules.dep file format could
	  handle most of this problem:
	  "/lib/modules/.../isofs.o: [type=fs device=iso9660] dependencies"

config file:

	- Enable _really_ fine module selection by looking at $BOOTFILE
	  or maybe kernel build number for the benefit of kernel hackers.
	* Bjorn says: This is mostly solved with the "include", "define"
	  and "if" directives for /etc/modules.conf.  Note that the kmod
	  environment to modprobe is _very_ sparse...
