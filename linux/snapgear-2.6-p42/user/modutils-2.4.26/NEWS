Since -pre6:
  - Picked up Philip Blundell's changes from the opengroup CVS tree.
  - Picked up RTH's changes from the opengroup CVS tree.
  - Add support for ksymoops debugging of modules.

Since -pre2:
  - Upgraded "create_syms" to be usable after a kernel "make modules_install"
  - Added option "-q" to insmod and modprobe for silent loading.
  - Depmod logic restructured, Test an extreme case with /etc/modules.conf:
	depfile=/lib/modules/modules.dep
	path=/lib/modules
    This is example is just for testing, but it is a good test.
    You might like the "-q" option to depmod...
    With "-q" modprobe will now silently seriously probe for a good stack.

    Strong recommendation: Always use modprobe rather than insmod,
    unless you absolutely have to (such as if you are developing
    a new module)!!! You will only gain from this strategy.

Since snap-990308:
  - Additional keywords for /etc/modules.conf:
	if, else, elseif, endif, include, define, above, below
  - Also uses wordexp() or glob() if available.
  - All arguments in config files are expanded w.r.t. meta-characters.
  - New depmod options (some especially for distribution maintainers):
	-C file		Use alternate config file
	-F file		Read kernel symbols from a file
	-b base		Work with a moved image of /lib/modules
	-q		Keep QUIET about unresolved symbols
	-n		Don't do it, just show it
   - Modprobe has (most of) the same additional options.

Since snap-990228:
  - Fixed a buffer overflow in depmod, bug report from:
    Jochen Friedrich <jochen@scram.de>

Since 2.1.121:
  - Heavy restructuring
  - Made "modprobe -r" able to clean up "autoclean" modules.
  - Replaced modprobe and depmod with updated C++ versions based on
    the work of Jacques Gelinas.
  - Converted modprobe to C and merged it with insmod

Since 2.1.107:

  - ARM and MIPS ports added.
  - Compilation in a separate directory works.

Since 2.1.85:

  - Insmod's -L parameter used by modprobe to prevent races.

Since 2.1.71:

  - Handling of local symbols revamped, so that ld -r objects work
    properly when they have "conflicting" symbols.
  - Modules may have .*.init sections which are freed after init_module
    runs.  Note that the module must have _very_ large initial data for
    this to have any effect at all.  Modules with large firmware blocks
    to download are good candidates though.
  - Aliases are now matched through globbing (for devfs), and
    aliases of aliases resolve properly.

Since 2.1.55:

  - Build process now uses an autoconf-generated configure script.
  - New program modinfo to display information embedded in the object
    files of 2.1.x-style modules (by Tom Dyas, still in development).
  - Recognize quoted parameter strings for 2.0.x modules.
  - Kerneld zombie bug fixed.
